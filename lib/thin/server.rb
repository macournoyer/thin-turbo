module Thin
  # The uterly famous Thin HTTP server.
  # It listen for incoming request through a given backend
  # and forward all request to +app+.
  #
  # == TCP server
  # Create a new TCP server on bound to <tt>host:port</tt> by specifiying +host+
  # and +port+ as the first 2 arguments.
  #
  #   Thin::Server.start('0.0.0.0', 3000, app)
  #
  # == UNIX domain server
  # Create a new UNIX domain socket bound to +socket+ file by specifiying a filename
  # as the first argument. Eg.: /tmp/thin.sock. If the first argument contains a <tt>/</tt>
  # it will be assumed to be a UNIX socket. 
  #
  #   Thin::Server.start('/tmp/thin.sock', nil, app)
  #
  # == Using a custom backend
  # You can implement your own way to connect the server to its client by creating your
  # own Backend class and pass it as the first argument.
  #
  #   backend = Thin::Backends::MyFancyBackend.new('galaxy://faraway:1345')
  #   Thin::Server.start(backend, nil, app)
  #
  # == Rack application (+app+)
  # All requests will be processed through +app+ that must be a valid Rack adapter.
  # A valid Rack adapter (application) must respond to <tt>call(env#Hash)</tt> and
  # return an array of <tt>[status, headers, body]</tt>.
  #
  # == Building an app in place
  # If a block is passed, a <tt>Rack::Builder</tt> instance
  # will be passed to build the +app+. So you can do cool stuff like this:
  # 
  #   Thin::Server.start('0.0.0.0', 3000) do
  #     use Rack::CommonLogger
  #     use Rack::ShowExceptions
  #     map "/lobster" do
  #       use Rack::Lint
  #       run Rack::Lobster.new
  #     end
  #   end
  #
